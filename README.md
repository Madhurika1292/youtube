YouTube is the most popular and most used video platform in the world today. YouTube has a list of trending videos that
are updated constantly. Here I will use Python with some packages like Pandas and Matplotlib to analyze a dataset and
represent observation via different graphs.
The dataset contains data more than 40,000 trending videos. I have analyzed this data to get insights into YouTube
trending videos, to see what is common between these videos. Those insights might also be used by YouTube creators
who want to increase popularity of their videos on YouTube.
